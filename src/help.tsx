      How can we state the fact that "right2 of a is c", "b is d", "c is e", "d is f", "e is g", "f is h". That is two rights of a file. We can enumerate all of the facts and write them manually, or spot the pattern: "Two rights of X is, as we imagine there exists a file Z where right of X is Z and right of Z is Y".
    </p>
    <p>
    Try to state this fact, using the comma operator as and.
    </p>
    <p>
     For extra practice, state <span class="atom">left2(X-Y)</span>, <span class="atom">up2(X-Y)</span> and <span class="atom">down2(X-Y)</span> facts. Get comfortable for the next challenge where we answer the fact that "righter to a to h is the list [b,c,d,e,f,g]".

    <p>

    Let\'s tell machine "left of b is a" using the fact that "right of a is b".
    Because for all the facts that "right of X is Y" it is also a fact that "left of Y is X".
    </p>

    <p>
    <span class="atom"> left(X-Y) :- right(Y-X). </span>
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice you can still state <span class="atom"> left(b-a). </span> manually for all files and machine will correspond the same.
    </p>


    <p>
    <small>
      If you use a variable that is not a file, like <span class="atom">left(apple, x).</span>, it is still a fact, but machine won\'t correspond, because it also checks for a fact that X and Y are files, and "left of X is Y" to correspond. Just an implicit extra rule. Like this: <span class="atom"> show_arrow(X, Y) :- left(X, Y), file(X), file(Y).</span> . To define the fact to show an arrow, three other facts are stated by a logical "and" clause, (by a comma), meaning that "show an arrow from X to Y when left of X is Y and X is a file and Y is a file".
    </small>
    </p>


    <p>
    <small>
     If you want to practice, same concepts apply to 8 ranks, being they have up and down. So define the facts <span class="atom">rank(1)</span> thru 8. and <span class="atom">up(1-2)</span> and <span class="atom">down(X-Y)</span> in terms of up.

   This gives order to files, because machine can answer "right of a is b".
  </p>
  <p>
   State all the facts for each file that has a right file neighbor.
   Notice "h" doesn't have a right file neighbor, so we don't state anything for right of "h".

     A <span class="atom">file(X)</span> structure just floats around.
     </p>
     <p>
     Notice the <span class="atom">right(X-Y)</span> structure. A dash pairs two words, and fits in place of one word inside paranthesis.
    </p>
    <p>
     Machine can answer the blank, if we put an uppercase word in place of left or right side of a pair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Write some structures with paired words. Then ask a question by writing an uppercase word in place of one of the pairs.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, if there is a <span class="atom"> right(a-b) </span> , and we ask for <span class="atom"> right(X-b) </span>, it answers <span class="atom"> X = b </span> .
